# MPILHLT Concepts of Work Time Regulations

This repository contains a systematic taxonomy used to describe different aspects of non-state working regulations such as contracts and company regulations. As the decision whether to maintain the different aspects in separate taxonomy schemes or to merge them into one big (heterogeneous) scheme is still pending, the repository contains both a combined file (`work_time_regulation.ttl`) and a series of separate skos files (for actions, physical objects and spaces, prescriptive aspects, reflexive and meta-aspects, regulation terms and social roles).

The taxonomy has been revised last: Sept 2023. It is a SKOS vocabulary encoded in ttl/"turtle" format.

These concepts serve to annotate full texts of such regulations in the context of the project [Non-state law of the economy. The normative order of industrial relations in the metal industry from the Empire to the early years of the Federal Republic of Germany](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/research-project/non-state-law-of-the-economy) at [Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/en), Frankfurt.

As authors, the following contributors should be credited: Peter Collin, Matthias Ebbertz, Polina Solonets, Benjamin Spendrin, Tim-Niklas Vesper, Andreas Wagner and Johanna Wolf. Encoding the scheme in SKOS was done by Andreas Wagner.

The classification scheme(s) are free to be re-used under a CC-0 license. (We would appreciate if the project or the authors were mentioned, however.)
